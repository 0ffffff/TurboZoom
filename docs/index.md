TurboZoom is a Google Chrome extension that aims to streamline the user's experience with Zoom.

### Our idea

Over remote learning, as students we have used Zoom frequently to attend classes. We quickly realized that using Zoom links litters the browser with unnecessary tabs and ask for permission to open the Zoom app multiple times.

These setbacks lead to wasted minutes every day that slowly accumulate into many lost hours.

### TurboZoom

This led us to create TurboZoom: a Chrome extension that integrates with the Zoom app seamlessly. Our solution features two main features:
1. TurboZoom will read Zoom links from the clipboard and automatically create a link that launches directly in the Zoom app itself, saving time, CPU usage, and memory.
2. TurboZoom saves these links in Chrome so that they're easy to find and can be re-accessed whenever needed.

### Future plans

- Adding native apps to operating systems such as MacOS, Windows, Linux, etc.
- In-App zoom plugin to further integrate the process
- Adaptive artificial intelligence to learn common patterns and meetings at certain times
- Configurability within the Chrome extension as well as in future applications
